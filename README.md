# Mental Health EDA & Ensemble

This repository focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building an **Ensemble Machine Learning Model** to understand and analyze patterns in mental health datasets.

---

## Project Overview

Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, and this project aims to:

1. Explore mental health datasets through detailed EDA.
2. Identify trends, correlations, and key insights.
3. Build predictive models using ensemble learning techniques to provide actionable outcomes.

---

## Dataset

The project leverages publicly available mental health datasets. Ensure that you download or use the dataset as specified in the notebook.
